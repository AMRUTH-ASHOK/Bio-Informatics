Brief: (k-1)mers are arranged as nodes in a graph, the edges follow a particular logic for its placement. This gives us a graph. The primary objective here is to find a eulerian path in the graph (if any) and use this path to reconstruct the String.

Note: There might be multiple eulerian paths in a given graph, hence multiple reconstructed strings are prevalent. Eulerian string reconstruction does not necessarily give a unique output. This is a drawback of this algorithm, and it is addressed in Paired Debruijn String Reconstruction methods.
