## The algorithm followed in this method is clearly explained in the below video

Note: Naive Approach to String Reconstruction is a primitive approach and follows a fairly simple algorithm; it has more cons than pros, String Reconstruction works only for a few sequences which follow a particular format. This issue is addressed in Hamiltonian, Debruijn and Paired Debruijn String Reonstruction methods.
