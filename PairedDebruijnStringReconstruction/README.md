Note: The primary objective is to arrange the kmers as a graph, find a eulerian path and subsequently reconstruct the string based on the eulerian path. Paired Debruijn String Reconstruction gives a unique reconstructed string. The code has been made as generic as possible, hence it works with even 100000 base pairs or higher.


A comparison of efficiency and performance of Hamiltonian, Debruijn, and Paired Debruijn String reconstruction has been made.
